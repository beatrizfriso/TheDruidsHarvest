# The Druid's Harvest 🌱 - WIP

The Druid's Harvest API is a .NET-based web API for managing a greengrocer, designed for study purposes. It provides endpoints for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting fruits in a inventory, serves as a learning resource for understanding API development using .NET technologies.

This repository has a funny origin. Years ago, I was just starting my career as a developer at a company full of amazing people. It was there that I took my first steps in programming, and one of the projects suggested for practice was a greengrocer system. At the time, my friend and I, who also worked there, were quite intimidated by the task, but we managed to pull it off. Now, almost three years later, I’m excited to rebuild this system with everything I’ve learned since then.

- [ ] CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for fruits and vegetables in a greengrocer.
